# Homebrew API

This is a reference implementation of a RESTful api in dropwizard and JAX-RS.  This was initially the subject for presentation. It is currently being reworked for the latest version of dropwizard and lessons learned over the last two years.

## Plans
* Finish initial upgrade to dropwizard 2.
* Rip out mongo for postgres (justification below)
* Decision justification pages
* Docker. Docker for testing. Docker for deployes. Docker, Docker, Docker. Can't say enough good.
* Competing implementation (but different api) in Spring Boot
* Some stream processing for reference implementation and complete architecture description.
